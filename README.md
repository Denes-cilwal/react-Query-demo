# Getting Started with React Query

- A library for fetching data in React Application.

# Requirement of React-Query:
- Since,React is UI library, there is no specific pattern for data fetching.
- We normally use useEffect for data fetching and useState hook to maintain component state like loading error or resulting data.
- if data is needed throughout the app, we tend to use state management libraries
- Most of the state management libraries are good for working with client state
- State management libraries are not great for working with asynchronous or server state.
